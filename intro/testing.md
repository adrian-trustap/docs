# Test

Trustap uses two environments for our API.

```JSON {% title="Production environment" %}
https://dev.trustap.com/api/v1/
```

```JSON {% title="Test environment" %}
https://dev.stage.trustap.com/api/v1/
```

Use the test environment to learn about the Trustap API for the first time, integrate it into your project, and try out new features.

When you first sign up with Trustap, our support team sends you the following credentials for your account. 

1. Your test `<API_KEY>`.
2. Your `<CLIENT_ID>`.
3. Your `<WEBHOOK_USERNAME>` and `<WEBHOOK_PASSWORD>`

* You will not incur any charges to your account in your test environment. 
* Your test environment is completely separate from your production environment. You can make changes to your test environment without affecting your production environment.
* When ready, Trustap will send you your production environment credentials.
